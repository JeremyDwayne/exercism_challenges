## What is Exercism?
[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is a platform for learning and mastering new programming languages. This repo is a collection of my solutions.

## What Am I Currently Mastering?
- [Go](https://exercism.org/tracks/go)
- [Typescript](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript)

### Ruby?
You'll probably find some [ruby](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby) in here at some point. I have around 8 years experience with ruby, but you can always learn more!
I plan on going through their ruby educational track and practice problems to learn what I dont know already and to keep my skills sharp.
